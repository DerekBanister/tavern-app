* Switched hosts from Heroku to CyclicSH.

* This app is being designed to solve a problem my friends and I have run into in the game Old School runescape.
* TLDR: Our clan on old school runescape is constantly reaching the maximum amount of members, prompting us to have to kick inactive members to make room for new active ones. This process is currently a bit annoying, so this is an attempt to automate that process using [TempleOSRS API](https://templeosrs.com/api_doc.php).
